# Hi, I'm Tom 👋

A passionate developer with years over 9+ years experience both leading teams and creating applications that not only meet but exceed client and user expectations.

I believe that creating applications requires a combination of technical skills, creativity, and innovation. That's why I'm constantly seeking new and exciting ways to push the boundaries of what's possible in app development.

My deep understanding of mobile frameworks, programming languages, and software design patterns allows me to approach each project with a fresh perspective. But it's not just about the technical skills. I'm a strong communicator and collaborator, working closely with cross-functional teams to understand the needs of clients and end-users. I'm always thinking outside the box and coming up with innovative solutions to meet these needs.

So let me know if you want to work together always excited for the next challenge.
